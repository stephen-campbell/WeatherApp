Some notes:  
There are four places (to my knowledge) where you might need to change the SQL database connection password. These include:  
submissionServlet.java, loginServlet.java, registerServlet.java, profile,jsp.  
In addition, there is a file, makeDatabase.sql, that must be run in order for the whole thing to work.  

Other than that, please let me know if something fails to run.  
Thanks,  
Stephen
