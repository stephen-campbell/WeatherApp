Some notes:  
There are four places (to my knowledge) where you might need to change the SQL database connection password. These include:  
submissionServlet.java, loginServlet.java, registerServlet.java, profile,jsp.  
In addition, there is a file, makeDatabase.sql, that must be run in order for the whole thing to work.  
Also, there's a peculiarity with my package for the .java files. It still says hw2 even though this is my hw3. I just didn't have the time to properly change this, sorry.  
Other than that, please let me know if something fails to run.  
Thanks,  
Stephen
